    </div>
    <h3>I created this website to provide myself a platform to practice and improve my technical skills as well as show off my abilities. I am focused primarily on projects involving machine learning, Python, R, and data visualization but also choose problems
        that are just interesting and allow me to learn new things. Initially created in Summer of 2021 not too long after I started my Masters in Analytics at Georgia Tech, the website is continuously updated as I add new projects or find new ways to
        improve the UI or my code. See below for description of technologies used in the site.</h3>

    <h3>All of the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jmanzion/jessica-personal-website" target="_blank">here.</a></h3>

    <h3>If you have any feedback or suggestions to improve this site or ideas for projects, please <a href="/contact">contact me.</a></h3>

            <h3>I chose Angular for the front end since it is a popular dynamic and interactive language. Using Typescript, it is essentially a super JavaScript and allows for debugging directly within the browser. Even though it does have a steeper learning
                curve, it has two bindings and automatically handles the program flows based on requirements provided.</h3>

            <h3>Python is the primary language I have used for my masters program and it is commonly used in machine learning. Also, it is readable and maintainable as well as compatible with major platforms and systems. Flask is a framework to allow python
                to be used within a web application. It is very flexible and does not enforce any certain requirements unlike other frameworks.</h3>
